msgid "Ramadan is one of the five requirements (or pillars) of Islam. During each of its 30 days, Muslims are obligated to fast from dawn until sunset. During this time they are supposed to abstain from food, drinking liquids, smoking, and sexual relations.\n"
"\n"
" In %1$s, women typically spend the afternoons preparing a big meal. At sunset, families often gather to break the fast. Traditionally the families break the fast with a drink of water, then three dried date fruits, and a multi-course meal. After watching the new Ramadan TV series, men (and some women) go out to coffee shops where they drink coffee, and smoke with friends until late into the night.\n"
"\n"
" Though many %2$s have stopped fasting in recent years, and lots of %2$s are turned off by the hypocrisy, increased crime rates, and rudeness that is pervasive through the month, lots of %2$s become more serious about religion during this time. Many attend the evening prayer services and do the other ritual prayers. Some even read the entire Quran (about a tenth the length of the Bible). This sincere seeking makes it a strategic time for us to pray for them."
msgstr "Ramadan is een van de vijf vereisten (of pijlers) van de islam. Tijdens elk van de 30 dagen zijn moslims verplicht om te vasten van zonsopgang tot zonsondergang. Gedurende deze tijd moeten ze zich onthouden van eten, drinken, roken en seksuele relaties.\n"
"\n"
" In %1$s besteden vrouwen meestal de middagen aan het bereiden van een grote maaltijd. Bij zonsondergang komen families vaak samen om het vasten te verbreken. Traditioneel verbreken de families het vasten met een slok water, daarna drie gedroogde dadels en een meergangenmaaltijd. Na het bekijken van de nieuwe Ramadan-tv-serie gaan mannen (en sommige vrouwen) naar coffeeshops waar ze koffie drinken en roken ze tot laat in de nacht met vrienden.\n"
"\n"
"Hoewel veel %2$s de afgelopen jaren zijn gestopt met vasten en veel %2$s werden afgeschrikt door de hypocrisie, toegenomen misdaadcijfers en onbeschoftheid die de hele maand door alomtegenwoordig is, worden veel %2$s serieuzer over religie in deze tijd. Velen wonen de avondgebedsdiensten bij en doen de andere rituele gebeden. Sommigen lazen zelfs de hele Koran (ongeveer een tiende van de lengte van de Bijbel). Dit oprechte zoeken maakt het voor ons een strategisch moment om voor hen te bidden. "
