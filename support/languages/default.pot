"Ramadan is one of the five requirements (or pillars) of Islam. During each "
"of its 30 days, Muslims are obligated to fast from dawn until sunset. "
"During this time they are supposed to abstain from food, drinking liquids, "
"smoking, and sexual relations.\n"
"\n"
" In Tunisia, women typically spend the afternoons preparing a big meal. At "
"sunset, families often gather to break the fast. Traditionally the "
"families break the fast with a drink of water, then three dried date "
"fruits, and a multi-course meal. After watching the new Ramadan TV series, "
"men (and some women) go out to coffee shops where they drink coffee, and "
"smoke with friends until late into the night.\n"
"\n"
" Though many Tunisians have stopped fasting in recent years, and lots of "
"Tunisians are turned off by the hypocrisy, increased crime rates, and "
"rudeness that is pervasive through the month, lots of Tunisians become "
"more serious about religion during this time. Many attend the evening "
"prayer services and do the other ritual prayers. Some even read the entire "
"Quran (about a tenth the length of the Bible). This sincere seeking makes "
"it a strategic time for us to pray for them."
