"Ramadan is one of the five requirements (or pillars) of Islam. During each "
"of its 30 days, Muslims are obligated to fast from dawn until sunset. "
"During this time they are supposed to abstain from food, drinking liquids, "
"smoking, and sexual relations.\n"
"\n"
" In %1$s, women typically spend the afternoons preparing a big meal. At "
"sunset, families often gather to break the fast. Traditionally the "
"families break the fast with a drink of water, then three dried date "
"fruits, and a multi-course meal. After watching the new Ramadan TV series, "
"men (and some women) go out to coffee shops where they drink coffee, and "
"smoke with friends until late into the night.\n"
"\n"
" Though many %2$s have stopped fasting in recent years, and lots of %2$s "
"are turned off by the hypocrisy, increased crime rates, and rudeness that "
"is pervasive through the month, lots of %2$s become more serious about "
"religion during this time. Many attend the evening prayer services and do "
"the other ritual prayers. Some even read the entire Quran (about a tenth "
"the length of the Bible). This sincere seeking makes it a strategic time "
"for us to pray for them."
